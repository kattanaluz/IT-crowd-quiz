# Practice Project: IT Crowd Quiz
This is a simple practice project. My main goal with this project is practice using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The application
The application itself is a single page app where the user can play with an quiz about the series IT Crowd.

## Challenges
While developing this project, I could practice how to work and build a page using HTML and CSS, and also how to apply logic using Vanilla JavaScript.
